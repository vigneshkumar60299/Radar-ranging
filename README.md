#EVALUATION OF RADAR RANGE USING PYTHON



Aim:

To calculate the maximum range of a radar system using the Radar Range Equation and verify the results through Python programming.



Theory:

The Radar Range Equation is a fundamental formula used in radar system design to determine the maximum range at which a radar can detect a target. It is given by:






Procedure

1.	Set Up the Python Environment: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can use Anaconda for managing Python packages and environments, or any other Python IDE of your choice.

2.	Import Necessary Libraries: Import the math library in Python.

3.	Define the Radar Range Equation Function: Create a function to calculate the maximum range using the Radar Range Equation.

4.	Input Parameters for the Radar System: Define the input parameters such as transmitted power, transmitter gain, receiver gain, radar frequency, radar cross section, and minimum detectable power.

5.	Calculate the Maximum Range: Use the function to calculate the maximum range of the radar.

6.	Execute the Program: Run the Python script to calculate and display the maximum range of the radar.



Result:



Thus, the maximum range of a radar system using the Radar Range Equation is verified t
hrough a Python program.
